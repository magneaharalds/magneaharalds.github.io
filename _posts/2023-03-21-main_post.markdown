## Introduction
In this assignment we will be looking into data about crimes in San Fransisco from 2003 to 2018. The data is available at [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry). Note that the original data is until May 2018, but we are only using data from 2003 through 2017.

There are a total of 2,084,466 rows in the filtered data, each with 35 columns. It contains information about the type of crime, the time and date of the crime, the location of the crime, the district in which the crime took place, the resolution (arrested, booked etc.) and other not as relevant information. 

We will specifically be looking into drug/narcotic crimes and how they have changed over the years. 

We start with a calendar plot that shows how many drug/narcotic crimes were recorded each day over the years 2003-2017.

On this plot we see that after year 2010/2011 drug related crimes seem to decrease steadily over the years until the end of the dataset. 

One reason for this sudden decrease around 2011 could be because of the decriminalization of marijuana posession where possessing less than an ounce of marijuana went from a misdemeanor to an infraction. [Source](https://www.gavel.io/automation/timeline-of-marijuana-laws-in-california). To look further into this we plot the drug related crimes according to which drug they are related to. 
We have created a plot showing drug crimes per year categorized by drug types. We did this by filtering out crimes that are unrelated to specific drug types so it is worth noting that this does not add up to all drug/narcotic crimes recorded each year.

We see the same decrease here around 2010/2011 as we saw in the calendarplot for most drug types. Like we suspected we see a big decrease in marijuana crimes around 2011 and another steep drop from 2016 to 2017 but in 2016 California legalized recreational marijuana which might explain this drop in crimes.

We also see a big decrease in cocaine related crimes around the same time. We see some decrease in crimes related to controlled substances also.  This decrease in cocaine is well known and there has been some reaserch done into what might be the cause. There are evidents that the demand for cocaine in the US overall deacreased a lot on the late 2000's compared to the world market. Also starting in 2007 there was an increase in the price of cocaine causing casual users to stop using cocaine and regular users to switch to cheaper drugs.

We see some decrease in crimes related to controlled substances also however heroine and meth-amphetamine do not show the same decrease but remaine relatively the same over the period. 

While opiate related crimes are not as many as the other crimes we do see an upward trend for them. This goes hand in hand with increased use of drugs like Oxycontin and Fentanyl in all of the USA.

We map the police districts in San Francisco where we show the number of drug/narcotic crimes for each district. We see that Tenderloin is by far the district with the most drug crimes. We map the police districts in San Francisco where we show the number of drug/narcotic crimes for each district. We see that Tenderloin is by far the district with the most drug crimes. This is a direct consequence of the fact that Tenderloin is the district in San Francisco that has the biggest drug problem still today. In this article [article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/These-charts-show-how-drug-incidents-in-the-16723745.php) from 2021 it is stated that 60% of San Francisco drug incidents happen in Tenderloin. The drug problem has only become worse over the years as opiod use increases and drugs like fentanyl have become more popular. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWBzxr3c29s) is a video of showing the state of Tenderloin about a year ago.
