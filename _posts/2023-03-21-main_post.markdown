## Introduction
In this assignment we will be looking into data about crimes in San Fransisco from 2003 to 2018. The data is available at [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry). Note that the original data is until May 2018, but we are only using data from 2003 through 2017.

There are a total of 2,084,466 rows in the filtered data, each with 35 columns. It contains information about the type of crime, the time and date of the crime, the location of the crime, the district in which the crime took place, the resolution (arrested, booked etc.) and other not as relevant information. 

We will specifically be looking into drug/narcotic crimes and how they have changed over the years. 

We start with a calendar plot that shows how many drug/narcotic crimes were recorded each day over the years 2003-2017.

On this plot we see that after year 2010/2011 drug related crimes seem to decrease steadily over the years until the end of the dataset. 

One reason for this sudden decrease around 2011 could be because of the decriminalization of marijuana posession. [Source](https://www.gavel.io/automation/timeline-of-marijuana-laws-in-california). To look further into this we plot the drug related crimes according to which drug they are related to.
