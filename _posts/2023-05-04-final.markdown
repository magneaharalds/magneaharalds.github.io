# Analysis of the San Fransisco fire department response time to medical incidents in recent years

## Introduction {#introduction}
As the Covid-19 pandemic becomes a part of the past for most people it is still impacting the lives of first responders. In this article we will deep dive into data from the San Francisco fire department, highlighting the years 2017-2022. (The city of San Francisco has a population of  808.437 residents as of 2022  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CASANF0POP" target="_blank">[1]</a> and covers 121.4 km^2 of land <a href="https://archive.ph/2020.02.13-235157/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/GCTPH1.CY07/0500000US06075#selection-651.0-651.5" target="_blank">[2]</a>.) The 911 dispatchers in San Francisco receive on average around EINHVER TALA number of calls per day. In the pandemic San Francisco usually had a lower number of Covid-19 cases per capita than the average in the USA. That on the other hand changed at the end of December when the whole world had been dealing with the delta wave and then omicron hit. That’s when covid cases in San Francisco really started increasing.

We therefore want to look into how this massive amount of Covid cases impacted the fire department in San Francisco (FDSF), more specifically we will look into how the response time in FDSF has developed through the years.  We also want to investigate how the response time varies neighborhood to neighborhood. The data we will use for this analysis is available at <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3" target="_blank">DataSF</a>. 


## The Data {#data}

We will start by looking at the average response time per month over the years 2012-2022 for different call types. The most common call types in the data set are Medical incidents and Traffic Collision, and another interesting call type is Structure Fire. This is why we have choisen these three call types to display in figure 0. In Figure 0 we see that the average response time per month Medical Incidents has seen an increase starting mid of 2020 as well as having a peek in August 2014. We also see a similar peek for Traffick Collision in 2014 but we see a steap decrease at the beginning of the pandemic and it has been lower than it was before the pandemic. It is quite interesting to see this increase in Medical Incident response time and decrease in Traffic collision response time compared to the trends before the pandemic. To investigate this further we need to see how the trend in overall average calls per day changes. This can be seen in figure 1 and in fact we see a drop in the number of calls per day. We see that clearly something is going on in the Medical incident respons time and we will look further into that.

To dive deeper into the evolution of the average response time for medical incidents we can look at a calendar plot (figure 3) of the average response time per day for the years 2017-2022. In this plot we see that there is a gradual increase in the response time in 2021 and then in 2022 it remains quite constant at that new higher level of response time with the exception of the first weeks of the year where the average response time seems to reach a peak. Note that for the first 10 days in April the dataset is lacking data on the calls. This increase in response time starts around the same time as the delta variant of Covid-19 starts to become dominant and then this peak we see at the beginning of the year 2022 is consistent with a huge wave of covid cases the city saw in December/ early January.

Since response time is the time from when one calls 911 to the time a firefighter or EMT is at your location there is a lot happening in the backround. We have split the response time into three subtimes called Intake time, Queue time and Travel time. Intake time
