# Include a static image
An image can be included in a markdown file with:

`![title of image](/path/to/image.jpg)`

This is an image of a cool cat

![A cool cat](/assets/images/cool_cat.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

# Include a bokeh plot
Make a file `plot.html` with the following code:

```python
from bokeh.io import output_file, show

output_file("figs/plot.html")
# Make the plot p
show(p)
```

After saving it in `./_layouts`, it can be included in a markdown file with this line:

{`% include week6.html %`}

This is a plot showing crimes per hour by category that we made in week 6. 
{% include week6.html %}
