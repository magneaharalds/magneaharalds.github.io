## Introduction {#introduction}
As the COVID-19 pandemic becomes a part of the past for most people, it is still impacting the lives of first responders. In this article we will dive deep into data from the San Francisco fire department, highlighting the years 2017-2022. During the pandemic San Francisco usually had a lower number of COVID-19 cases per capita than the average in the USA <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/covid-cases-san-francisco-17171776.php" target="_blank">[1]</a>. That, on the other hand, changed at the end of December when the whole world had been dealing with the Delta wave and following that the Omicron variant. Thatâ€™s when COVID-19 cases in San Francisco really started to increase.

We therefore want to look into how this massive amount of COVID-19 cases impacted the fire department in San Francisco (SFFD), along with looking into how the response time in SFFD has developed through the years. We will also investigate how the response time varies between neighborhoods. The data we will use for this analysis is available at <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3" target="_blank">DataSF</a>. 

Fore those interested all code and further technical analysis can be found at the notebook linked at the top of this page. 


## Response time throughout the years {#years}

We will begin by looking at the average response time per month over the years 2012-2022 for different call types. The most common types of incident calls in San Francisco are *Medical incidents* and *Traffic Collisions*, and another interesting call type is *Structure Fire*. This is why we have chosen these three call types to display in Figure 1. In that figure we see that the average response time per month of *Medical Incidents* and *Traffic Collisions.* Infact in 2014 and 2015 the city hired new paramedics as a repsonse to the increasing response time <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/S-F-ambulance-response-times-still-below-goal-5980291.php" target="_blank">[2]</a>. In figure 1 we see that the response time decreases in 2014 indicating that this increase in personnel helped reduce the response time. We thus have a clear reason for the peak in 2014 and decide to focus the rest of the analysis on more recent years and the influence of COVID-19. The rest of the pluts thus only include the years 2017-2022. 

Looking at the effect of COVID-19 on *Medical incidents* we see an increase starting mid 2020 while for *Traffic collisions* we see a steep decrease at the beginning of the pandemic and it has since been lower than it was pre-pandemic. It is quite interesting to see this increase in *Medical Incident* response time and decrease in *Traffic collision* response time compared to the trends before the pandemic. To investigate this further we need to see how the trend in overall average calls per day changes. This can be seen in Figure 2 and surprisingly we see a drop in the number of calls per day. This indicates that clearly something is going wrong with the response time to *Medical Incidents* and we will look further into that.

</p>

To dive deeper into the evolution of the average response time for *Medical Incidents* we can look at a calendar plot (figure 3) of the average response time per day for the years 2017-2022. In this plot we see that there is a gradual increase in the response time in 2021 and then in 2022 it remains quite constant at that new higher level of response time with the exception of the first weeks of the year where the average response time seems to reach a peak. Note that for the first 10 days in April 2022 the dataset is lacking data on the calls. This increase in response time starts around the same time as the Delta variant of COVID-19 starts to become dominant and then this peak we see at the beginning of the year 2022 is consistent with a huge wave of COVID-19 cases the city saw in December/ early January.

Since response time is the time from when one calls 911 to the time a first responder is at your location there is a lot happening in the backround. We have split the response time into three subtimes called *Intake time*, *Queue time* and *Travel time*. *Intake time* is the time it takes from the 911 dispatcher answering to the time a fire department unit is requested. *Queue time* is the time it takes from the request being made until a unit responds. *Travel time* is then the time it takes for the unit to reach the location of the caller. We see that while *Intake time* holds pretty steady over the years the biggest increase seems to be in *Queue time* and a bit of increase in Response time. This suggests that *Queue time* might be causing some of the increase in response time we are seeing in the plots above. This suggests, that the current number of ambulances and emergency response personnel does not manage to handle all the incoming calls in an optimal amount of time.

<p align = "center">
<b>Figure 4: The average response time by year, split into intake, queue and travel time.</b>
</p>

Even though the increased response time is most likely explained by shortage in staff to respond to the demand in services we want to investigate other factors that might be influencing the response time. One possible explanation might be traffic or other environmental factors, therefore we will look into the *Travel time.* The Travel time is defined as the time it takes for the ambulance to get from the place of incident to the hospital. We look at a similar calendar plot as we did for the response time in figure 5. We see that there has clearly been a change in the travel time but it is very different to the changes we see in response time. In 2020 we see that the travel time decreases a great deal and then gradually through out 2021 it reaches similar response time as before 2020. This can be explained by the fact that in 2020 and a part of 2021 there were lockdowns in San Francisco so people either stayed home or even left the city <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/population-estimates-counties-decrease.html" target="_blank">[3]</a>.

Since the average transport time after COVID-19 never goes higher than the average transport time before the pandemic we can conclude that the increase in response time is not due to responders taking a longer time driving between places.

</p>

To compare the response time and the transport time even further we can look at a plot of the average response and transport time by the time of day through out the years. In figure 6 we see that the response time is less affected by the time of day than the transport time. This, again, indicates other factors than traffic have a big influence on response time while traffic is the probably biggest contributing factor to transport time.

## Response time in different neighborhoods {#neighborhoods}

Now that we have explored the response time through out the years in San Francisco we are also interested in seeing what else influences response time. We thus check if the response time varies neighborhood to neighborhood. To se this we have plotted the average response and transport times by neighborhood in the years 2018-2022 in figure 7. We see that the range of the transport times by neighborhoods is greater than the range of response time indicating that it takes longer to transport patients to hospital than responding in the first place. We also see the clear difference between neighborhoods in response and transport time which we investigate further in figures 8 and 9 on a map.

{% include final_plots/response_transport_neighborhood_years.html %}
<p align = "center">
<b>Figure 7: The average response and transport times by neighborhood over the years.</b>
</p>
In figure 8 we see the average response time for each neighborhood of San Francisco. It is interesting to see that the average response time in the neighborhoods outside of the city center have a clear longer response time. This might be explained by the fact that fire stations are placed closer together in the inner city than the city center, however it is worth noting that the city does have a good distribution of fire stations throughout the city <a href="https://fire.fandom.com/wiki/San_Francisco_Fire_Department" target="_blank">[4]</a>. However, in figure 8, we can see that the hospitals are placed more in the city center which could be influencing the differences in response time between neighborhoods. An article from The San Francisco Standard <a href="https://sfstandard.com/public-health/san-francisco-ambulance-emergency-response-time/" target="_blank">[5]</a> explains this furter. There it is explained that the increase in response time is due to the hospitals being overcrowded and first responders  not being able to leave patients until they formally pass care to hospital personnel. Thus first responders are having to wait sometimes a few hours until they can leave and respond to a new call leaving more ambulences stuck in the city center. 

In figure 9 we also have the average transport time where we clearly see that the further away from a hospital the call comes, the transport time is higher. This difference in transport time can most definitely be explained by the hospitals locations.

## Feature importance analysis {#ML}

We have seen that the response time has increased in recent years and the difference in response time between neighborhoods and time of day. We thus decided to train a Random forest model on a subset of the data to try and determine if those features are considered important by the model. The results can be seen in figure 10.

As can be seen in the plot, the most important feature in predicting response time, out of the ones used, is the *Year*. This makes sense compared to the clear increase in response time we saw over time. All levels of *Period of day* are deemed important but the most important out of those is *morning*. This is quite interesting given that we saw before that mornings and afternoons have very similar response times, although all times of day have similar response times. 

As for the neighborhoods, the ones shown in the figure all have similar importance. The neighborhoods should be familiar since we have already mentioned many of them in the analysis.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
The aim of this analysis was to shine light on response time of first responders in San Francisco. We wanted to se how it has changed over time and especially how COVID-19 impacted the response time. We also wanted to look into what other factors might impact response time. 

From the figures displayed on this site we saw a clear impact of COVID-19 on response time and that it has seen a clear increase in recent years. We discovered that one of the reasons for this is that the hospitals of San Francisco are too busy and first responders get stuck at the hospitals an are thus unable to respond to new calls. We also saw some differences in response between neighborhoods where response times are slower outside of the city center. Finally, we did some machine learning models to further analyse if the differences we saw were significant. 

On this site we have done a thurough analysis on response time of first responders in San Francisco. One can, however, always analyze this furhter and ideas for further analysis could be to look into priority of calls and how different priorities are affected by the factors we have investigated like time and location.
